- This folder contains solution for coding part of the Problem Set 6 (Theory part is completed but it's handwritten, LATEX format will be added in coming days).

- In Code part there two questions:

- In the first coding question a 2x2x2 rubic cube are solved using the algorithm called Bi-directional Search (It's bi-directional BFS actually and really really simple but also clever algorithm in order to reduce traverse time --> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bidirectional-search/). The code can solve 2x2x2 rubic whatever the initial state is.
- On an Apple Macbook Air M1/16 GB/8C - 8G system 7 tests are done in 2.339 seconds

- In the second coding question dijkstra algorithm are implemented in order to find shortest path between two cities using National Highway Planning Network data (which can be find in dijkstra folder).
-  On an Apple Macbook Air M1/16 GB/8C - 8G system 1 test (that consisting of 5 subtests) is done in 35.455 seconds
